Your task is to build a product title quality model that can automatically grade the clarity and the conciseness of a product title.

Each product in the data is also associated with two quality scores labeled by Lazada's internal QC team based on the following content guidelines.


Clarity
1 means within 5 seconds you can understand the title and what the product is. It easy to read. You can quickly figure out what its key attributes are (color, size, model, etc.).
0 means you are not sure what the product is after 5 seconds. it is difficult to read. You will have to read the title more than once.


Conciseness
1 means it is short enough to contain all the necessary information.
0 means it is too long with many unnecessary words. Or it is too short and it is unsure what the product is.
